# Analog

### This repository contains project reports related to various analog electronics projects undertaken as part of coursework and extracurricular activities at NITK. The projects focus on electronics design, embedded systems, and mixed-signal design.

## Projects

## 1. Alarm for Sleep Prevention

### Objective: Develop a system using a tilt sensor and an alarm to prevent sleep during critical tasks.

### Key Components: Tilt sensor, 555 Timer IC, Buzzer, LM7805 Voltage Regulator.

### Methodology: The tilt sensor detects signs of drowsiness and triggers a buzzer using a monostable multivibrator circuit.

### Results: Effective detection of drowsiness with real-time testing using Tinkercad.

## 2. Design of a 6-bit Fully Differential Current Steering DAC

### Objective: Design and simulate a 6-bit current-steering DAC for mixed-signal applications.

### Key Components: PMOS Current Sources, Row-Column Decoders, 180nm CMOS Process.

### Methodology: Implemented a fully differential DAC with a focus on minimizing INL and DNL errors.

### Results: Achieved low power consumption (<1mW) and INL/DNL < 0.5 LSB under random mismatch conditions.
